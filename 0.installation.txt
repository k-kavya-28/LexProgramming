install flex by running following command on the ubuntu terminal - sudo apt-get install flex
command - flex name.l - creates lex.yy.c file (default output file name) containing the generated C code for the lexical analyzer
now we compile lex.yy.c file with our main program, You will need to link it with the Flex library. Run the following command: gcc lex.yy.c -o floating_point_lexer -lfl

gcc command explanation:
1)lex.yy.c: This is the name of the C source code file that was generated by Flex (the Lex tool) from your .l Lex file. It contains the code for the lexical analyzer.
2)-o floating_point_lexer: The -o flag specifies the name of the output executable file. In this case, the name is floating_point_lexer. You can replace floating_point_lexer with any name you prefer for your executable.
3)-lfl: The -l flag is used to link a library to your program. In this case, -lfl tells the compiler to link the Flex library (libfl). The Flex library provides functions necessary for lexing (lexical analysis).
4)The executable is what you run in the terminal to execute your Lex-generated lexical analyzer.

/* to run the program
    flex name.l
    gcc lex.yy.c -o output/name -lfl
    cd output
    ./name
